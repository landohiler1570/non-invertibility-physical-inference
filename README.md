# Non-Invertible Electromagnetic Observation Operators

## Purpose

This repository contains a **methodological research artifact** analyzing electromagnetic observation as a
non-invertible projection from a higher-dimensional physical state space to lower-dimensional observables.

The central result is **structural**, not empirical:
electromagnetic observations (e.g., lensing, surface brightness, rotation curves) are modeled as projection
operators with **non-trivial, infinite-dimensional kernels**, implying that unique reconstruction of the
underlying 3D physical state is impossible without additional constraints.

This repository exists to make that structure explicit and auditable.

## What This Repository Is

- A **formal analysis** of inverse problems in astrophysical inference
- A **transparent audit trail** of assumptions and transformations
- A **reference artifact** documenting non-invertibility
- A **chain-of-custody** for the core mathematical claim

---

## What This Repository Is NOT

- It does **not** propose new physics
- It does **not** argue against dark matter, ΛCDM, or General Relativity
- It does **not** present parameter fits, likelihoods, or statistical claims
- It does **not** attempt to resolve cosmological tensions
- It does **not** make ontological claims about the nature of matter or spacetime

### `non_invertibility_manuscript.pdf`
The main methodological manuscript.  
It defines the physical state space, electromagnetic observation operators, and proves non-invertibility with
explicit physical examples.

### `CHAIN_OF_CUSTODY.txt`
A step-by-step audit record documenting:
- inputs
- forward operators
- explicit non-injectivity witnesses
- kernel identification
- where falsification would occur if an error exists

This file is provided so readers can inspect **exactly where** the argument would fail, if it does.

## Authorship and AI Use

This work was developed by a human author, who takes full responsibility for its content.
AI tools were used for drafting assistance, language refinement, and organizational support.

All mathematical claims, structure, and conclusions reflect the author’s intent and judgment.

## Intended Use

This repository is intended for:
- researchers working on inverse problems in physics or astronomy
- methodologists studying limits of inference
- readers seeking a clear separation between observation, inference, and model-dependent reconstruction

It is released as a **research artifact**, not as a claim of discovery.
