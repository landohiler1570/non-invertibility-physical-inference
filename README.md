# Non-Invertibility in Physical Inference

This repository archives a technical manuscript analyzing the
non-invertibility of common observational mappings in physics.

The work focuses on operator-level structure and demonstrates the
existence of large null spaces independent of model parameterization.

This document is provided as an archival reference and is not an
active research program.
